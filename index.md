# DNA Alignment Tutorial

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on DNA sequence alignment! This guide will take you through the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques used in bioinformatics for aligning DNA sequences.

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial covers the essential aspects of DNA alignment, from theoretical foundations to practical applications:

üß¨ **Theoretical Background**: Understanding the Smith-Waterman algorithm and alignment principles

üîç **Database Searching**: Using BLAST for fast similarity searches

üìÑ **File Formats**: Working with SAM/BAM files, the standard for alignment data

‚ö° **Performance Evaluation**: How to test and compare different alignment tools

üöÄ **Modern Tools**: Hands-on experience with Minimap2 for long-read alignment
