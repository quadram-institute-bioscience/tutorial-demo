# Introduction to DNA Alignment

Welcome to the DNA Alignment Tutorial! This comprehensive guide will take you through the fundamental concepts and practical tools used in DNA sequence alignment, a cornerstone technique in bioinformatics.

## What is DNA Alignment?

DNA sequence alignment is the process of arranging sequences of DNA to identify regions of similarity. These similarities often indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between sequences.

## Why is Alignment Important?

- **Gene identification**: Finding genes in newly sequenced genomes
- **Evolutionary analysis**: Understanding relationships between species
- **Variant detection**: Identifying mutations and polymorphisms
- **Functional annotation**: Predicting protein function from sequence similarity

## Types of Alignment

### Pairwise Alignment
Aligning two sequences to find the best match between them.

### Multiple Sequence Alignment
Aligning multiple sequences simultaneously to identify conserved regions.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial covers:

1. **Smith-Waterman Algorithm** - The gold standard for local alignment
2. **BLAST** - Fast database searching for similar sequences
3. **SAM Format** - Standard format for storing alignment results
4. **Testing Mappers** - How to evaluate alignment quality
5. **Minimap2** - Modern long-read alignment tool
